Define a role and add permissions to it. This will automatically create and
attach an IAM policy to the role:

```ts
    const role = new Role(this, 'MyRole', {
      assumedBy: new ServicePrincipal('sns.amazonaws.com')
    });

    role.addToPolicy(new PolicyStatement({
      resources: ['*'],
      actions: ['lambda:InvokeFunction'] }));
```

Define a policy and attach it to groups, users and roles. Note that it is possible to attach
the policy either by calling `xxx.attachInlinePolicy(policy)` or `policy.attachToXxx(xxx)`.

```ts
    const user = new User(this, 'MyUser', { password: SecretValue.plainText('1234') });
    const group = new Group(this, 'MyGroup');

    const policy = new Policy(this, 'MyPolicy');
    policy.attachToUser(user);
    group.attachInlinePolicy(policy);
```

Managed policies can be attached using `xxx.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName(policyName))`:

```ts
const group = new Group(this, 'MyGroup');
group.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('policy/AdministratorAccess'));
```

### Granting permissions to resources

Many of the AWS CDK resources have `grant*` methods that allow you to grant other resources access to that resource. As an example, the following code gives a Lambda function write permissions (Put, Update, Delete) to a DynamoDB table.

```typescript
const fn = new lambda.Function(...);
const table = new dynamodb.Table(...);

table.grantWriteData(fn);
```

The more generic `grant` method allows you to give specific permissions to a resource:

```typescript
const fn = new lambda.Function(...);
const table = new dynamodb.Table(...);

table.grant(fn, 'dynamodb:PutItem');
```

The `grant*` methods accept an `IGrantable` object. This interface is implemented by IAM principlal resources (groups, users and roles) and resources that assume a role such as a Lambda function, EC2 instance or a Codebuild project.

You can find which `grant*` methods exist for a resource in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).

### Configuring an ExternalId

If you need to create roles that will be assumed by 3rd parties, it is generally a good idea to [require an `ExternalId`
to assume them](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).  Configuring
an `ExternalId` works like this:

```ts
const role = new iam.Role(this, 'MyRole', {
  assumedBy: new iam.AccountPrincipal('123456789012'),
  externalIds: ['SUPPLY-ME'],
});
```

### Principals vs Identities

When we say *Principal*, we mean an entity you grant permissions to. This
entity can be an AWS Service, a Role, or something more abstract such as "all
users in this account" or even "all users in this organization". An
*Identity* is an IAM representing a single IAM entity that can have
a policy attached, one of `Role`, `User`, or `Group`.

### IAM Principals

When defining policy statements as part of an AssumeRole policy or as part of a
resource policy, statements would usually refer to a specific IAM principal
under `Principal`.

IAM principals are modeled as classes that derive from the `iam.PolicyPrincipal`
abstract class. Principal objects include principal type (string) and value
(array of string), optional set of conditions and the action that this principal
requires when it is used in an assume role policy document.

To add a principal to a policy statement you can either use the abstract
`statement.addPrincipal`, one of the concrete `addXxxPrincipal` methods:

* `addAwsPrincipal`, `addArnPrincipal` or `new ArnPrincipal(arn)` for `{ "AWS": arn }`
* `addAwsAccountPrincipal` or `new AccountPrincipal(accountId)` for `{ "AWS": account-arn }`
* `addServicePrincipal` or `new ServicePrincipal(service)` for `{ "Service": service }`
* `addAccountRootPrincipal` or `new AccountRootPrincipal()` for `{ "AWS": { "Ref: "AWS::AccountId" } }`
* `addCanonicalUserPrincipal` or `new CanonicalUserPrincipal(id)` for `{ "CanonicalUser": id }`
* `addFederatedPrincipal` or `new FederatedPrincipal(federated, conditions, assumeAction)` for
  `{ "Federated": arn }` and a set of optional conditions and the assume role action to use.
* `addAnyPrincipal` or `new AnyPrincipal` for `{ "AWS": "*" }`

If multiple principals are added to the policy statement, they will be merged together:

```ts
const statement = new PolicyStatement();
statement.addServicePrincipal('cloudwatch.amazonaws.com');
statement.addServicePrincipal('ec2.amazonaws.com');
statement.addArnPrincipal('arn:aws:boom:boom');
```

Will result in:

```json
{
  "Principal": {
    "Service": [ "cloudwatch.amazonaws.com", "ec2.amazonaws.com" ],
    "AWS": "arn:aws:boom:boom"
  }
}
```

The `CompositePrincipal` class can also be used to define complex principals, for example:

```ts
const role = new iam.Role(this, 'MyRole', {
  assumedBy: new iam.CompositePrincipal(
    new iam.ServicePrincipal('ec2.amazonaws.com'),
    new iam.AccountPrincipal('1818188181818187272')
  )
});
```

### Features

 * Policy name uniqueness is enforced. If two policies by the same name are attached to the same
   principal, the attachment will fail.
 * Policy names are not required - the CDK logical ID will be used and ensured to be unique.
